1.3 neilb 24-july-1998

	Switched to using HTTP::Request::Common (POST function).

	Now using Pod::Usage to generate the output for -help message.
	Added a -doc switch which displays the full pod (Pod::Usage again).

	Compacted the code using App::Config, given some new features
	in the latest version of App::Config.

	Added a prerequisite clause in Makefile.PL

1.2 neilb 2-april-1998

	The password was set to be expanded for variables by App::Config,
	since this is the default. Turned off this feature for password,
	since it can cause weirdness if you have potential variable refs
	in your PAUSE password. Thanks to Andy Wardley for having a
	bizarro password.

1.1 neilb

	first public release. only announced to p5p.
