1.2 neilb 2-april-1998

	The password was set to be expanded for variables by App::Config,
	since this is the default. Turned off this feature for password,
	since it can cause weirdness if you have potential variable refs
	in your PAUSE password. Thanks to Andy Wardley for having a
	bizarro password.

1.1 neilb

	first public release. only announced to p5p.
